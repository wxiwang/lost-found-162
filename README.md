# Groceries for Grandma

When the app comes up, it sends an AJAX request to the server
to get the current shopping list. 

The callback function on the browser displays the shopping list, by adding to the DOM.

This is just the beginning of an app, it is not finished.  Entering new items into the input box doesn't do anything.  You could think 
about how to finish it, as an exercise, if you want more practice with AJAX queries.  You'd need to store the 
shopping list on the server, in a file, for one thing.
